# Deep Q-Learning - Atari Space Invaders with Gym Retro   

Implementation of Deep Q-network trained to play Space Invaders. Used libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, Retro openai gym.
If you want to train a model you need to download ROM for Space Invaders - https://github.com/openai/retro/issues/53

Inspiration/resources: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems

This project is meant to be a practical exercise that tests the knowledge and skills i have acquired from the textbook.
